# **ADVENT OF CODE**
Twas the night before Christmas,

at a village-wide outcry,

as a (slighty incompetent) idiot,

gave Advent of Code a try.

### **2015: C#**
7/25
### **2019: C#**
4/25
### **2022: C#**
6/25
### **2023: ODIN**
3/25
*twas learning Odin*
### **2024: PYTHON** <small>and a little C#</small>
*my first year!*

25/25
- Most days only have Part 2 written for them because I just editing the Part 1 code. (all other years have both parts)
- Day 6 was rewritten in C# for performance because I was hell-bent on my brute force solution working.
- Day 13 uses NumPy
- Day 14 generates around 10,000 images and puts them in a folder.
- Day 15 was done in Unity (I did this purely for easy graphics because I felt like it).
- Day 24 generates a massive graph for part 2 (if you want the solution then replace line 4 with 'advent of code 2024 day 24 solutions' and then copy line 4 into a search engine)

### **2025: C#**
12/12

- The only thing that uses a library is Day 10 with z3 but the rest is my own stuff. (some are kinda input specific but as long as the input is somewhat similar it should still work)
