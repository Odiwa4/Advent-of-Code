**ADVENT OF CODE: JANKY EDITION**

Hello this is the code for my advent of code:


**2015: C#**

I started this year because I was bored. The first 7 days are there.

**2019: C# (again)**

This year has some intcode solutions, some badly coded ones but solutions none the less.

**2023: Odin**

This year was done in Odin, or the first two days at least. This was done purely to learn the language and so if the code is bad, that's why.

**2024: Python** 
<small>and a little bit of C#</small>


This contains all of 2024, (minus day 15 because I made it in unity). Also Day 6 Part 2 was in C# for efficiency (and because I was determined to see my stupid solution work)

day 14 puts 10,000 images in a folder so have fun with that I guess.

**2025: C#**

is anyone reading this?
