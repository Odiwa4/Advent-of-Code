**THE ADVENT OF CODE 2024: JANKY EDITION**

Whether it's misreading the prompt, overcomplicated things considerably, or just plain stupidity, insanity is inevitable, but hey with a little too much optimism, a nonexistent sleep schedule, and some good ol' Christmas spirit, anything is possible.

To run any of the scripts, just include the puzzle input named the file name the code needs and put it in the relevant day folder.

**Warning Below Text May Contain Traces of Yapping**:
- The following code is really janky.
- Alot of the time I changed the code to work for part 2, and forgot to make a second file. So if you see only one folder there, that's why.
- Day 14 when run puts 10,000 images into a folder so you have been warned

  <summary>neat trick for day 14</summary>
  You can sort by file size to find the tree

- day 15 was done in unity and someone cant be bothered to make a git repository (shame on whoever did that)
- day 6s python code is broken, the c# however does work
- uhhh is anyone reading this?
- oh and last thing my day 12 part 2 solution is **really** weird so just ignore that
