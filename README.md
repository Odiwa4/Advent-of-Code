**THE ADVENT OF CODE 2024**
Whether it's misreading the prompt, overcomplicated things considerably, or just plain stupidity, insanity is bound to happen.

But thats all apart of the christmas spirit!

to run any of the scripts just include the puzzle input named the file name the code needs and put it in the relevant day folder.

(oh and for day 6 run the c# version because the others are really really really slow (and the python one is also broken))

also some are only set up to work with part 2 so womp womp if you wanted to see part 1 okay ill end the yapping
